# Image-Morphing-Detection
Nowadays biometric systems are major technology in security. Even though the systems are efficient in recognizing images, such system cannot understand that an image has been modified or not. Morphing is an image transformation mechanism which is widely using for fool such intelligent systems. Nowadays people are extremely good at changing images using morphing techniques. Most of the crimes are happening nowadays on biometric systems are related to image morphing. As an example, airport entry system is time to time fooled by people using morphing. Tools like Photoshop, GIMP and GAP are often used for morphing and those images are hard to recognize as original or not.
